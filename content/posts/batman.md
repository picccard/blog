Hello world and welcome! \
My name is Eskil, I live in Norway and work as an cloud & devops engineer.

You migt be wondering "what is up with the post title?". \
Well this will be the first post and it won't have any parents... and since Batman also is an orphant, I've decided to name the post after him!
